Using OpenCVSharp wrapper to use the OpenCV libraries, as this wrapper supports Mono. The wrapper requires the x86/vc11 dlls. This can be added to the Windows PATH variable.

Some of this code was adapted from the opencvsharp camera calibration example: https://github.com/shimat/opencvsharp/blob/master/sample/CStyleSamplesCS/Samples/CalibrateCamera.cs
