Project to test the calibration of cameras inside Unity3D. 

Using OpenCVSharp wrapper to use the OpenCV libraries, as this wrapper supports Mono. The wrapper requires the x86/vc11 dlls. This can be added to the Windows PATH variable.

Some of this code was adapted from the opencvsharp camera calibration example: https://github.com/shimat/opencvsharp/blob/master/sample/CStyleSamplesCS/Samples/CalibrateCamera.cs

The Python code was extracted from Relax's rotation matrix code: http://svn.gna.org/svn/relax/1.3/maths_fns/rotation_matrix.py
